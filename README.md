## ICTSchool Installation


** First git clone
```
 https://github.com/ictinnovations/ICTSchool.git
 ```
#### Create ENV file
to create env file run, navigate to ICTSchool direcotry and run the following command.
```
cp .env.example .env
```
#### Database creds config in ENV

After create env file, enter database creds e.g.
```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=schoolapi
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

#### Create Database
After change configuration according to your need, create same name database which is defined in **env** file.

### Run Composer Command
After all configuration, we need to run **composer** command to install laravel and other packages. Run the following command
```
composer install
```
>After installing Laravel, you may need to configure some permissions. Directories within the storage and the bootstrap/cache directories should be writable by your web server or Laravel will not run.

After run **composer install**  run the following command to genrate **APP_KEY**, It is a private string (encryption_key) in your application that nobody knows about. So, if only your application knows the key, only your application can decrypt data that is encrypted by this key.
```
php artisan key:generate
```
### Database Migration
Migrations are like version control for your database, allowing your team to easily modify and share the application's database schema. Migrations are typically paired with Laravel's schema builder to easily build your application's database schema. If you have ever had to tell a teammate to manually add a column to their local database schema, you've faced the problem that database migrations solve.
```
$ php artisan migrate
```
```
$ php artisan db:seed
```
```
$ php artisan passport:install (for restfull Api)
```
```
$ php artisan storage:link
```
```
$ php artisan serve --port 8080
```
**  http://localhost:8080 **
```
$ php artisan storage:link

```
## cron job Settings
```
crontab -e

* * * * * /usr/bin/php7.1 /path/artisan schedule:run 1>> /dev/null 2>&1

```
